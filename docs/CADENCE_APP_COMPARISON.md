## Conclusion

**Cadence** is a mature, feature-complete bike computer replacement with professional polish, extensive features, and a proven track record. It's designed to be a paid product that competes directly with Garmin and Wahoo devices.

**Bike Power Tracker** is a focused, web-first PWA with a unique strength in live workout streaming and viewing. It's free, open-source, and simpler, but lacks many advanced features that serious cyclists expect.

### Recommendation Paths

**If you want BPT to compete with Cadence:**
- Focus on the unique streaming/viewer capabilities (your differentiator)
- Add navigation and structured workouts gradually
- Consider keeping it free but adding optional paid hosting/streaming
- Build the open-source community

**If you want BPT to stay focused:**
- Double down on streaming and social features
- Make the viewer experience amazing
- Add community features (comments, kudos, etc.)
- Keep it simple and web-first
- Market it as "Twitch for cycling workouts"

**Quick Wins to Implement:**
1. Lap functionality
2. Auto-pause
3. Basic route/elevation display
4. Activity notes
5. Strava export
6. More voice announcements
7. Customizable data screens
8. Heart rate and power zones

The comparison shows that Cadence is a comprehensive solution while BPT has carved out a unique niche in live workout streaming that Cadence doesn't really address.
