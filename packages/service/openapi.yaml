  title: BPT Service - Redis Streams API
  description: |
    A real-time messaging service built on Redis Streams with Server-Sent Events (SSE) support.

    This API provides endpoints to:
    - Create and manage Redis streams
    - Send messages to streams
    - Retrieve message history
    - Subscribe to real-time message updates via SSE

    ## Key Features
    - **Real-time messaging** using Server-Sent Events
    - **Persistent streams** backed by Redis
    - **Message history** with flexible querying
    - **Stream metadata** including message counts and IDs

    ## Base URL
    - Development: `http://localhost:3000`
    - Production: Configure via environment variables
